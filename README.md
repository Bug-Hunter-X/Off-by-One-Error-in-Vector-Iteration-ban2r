This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version. The error arises from using `<=` instead of `<` in the loop condition, resulting in an attempt to access an element outside the vector's valid range. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
